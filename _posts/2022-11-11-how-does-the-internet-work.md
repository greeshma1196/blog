We all know that Internet is a network of networks. It helps connect every system in the world. I can sit in my desk and request for some information and I will get it within a matter of seconds. How is it possible that a machine can retrieve information about something so random.

When I type in [Google.com](http://google.com) on the browser and hit enter, the browser calls an API (Application Interface Protocol) through which it sends my data and responds back with the answers I want. The question that arises here is how does the API know who to contact to get the right data back?

Here the concept of IP Addresses come into play. Each and every device connected to the internet has an IP Address which they use to communicate. Google has its own IP Address and so does your device. The IP Address is retrieved through a DNS Resolution. Once the IP Address is retrieved a connection can be established to send information to and fro.
